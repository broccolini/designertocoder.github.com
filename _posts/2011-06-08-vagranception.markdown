After the staggering mediocrity of [my last screencast][1], I immediately made
elaborate plans to create my next screencast. And here it is, five months of
110-hour weeks later. Well, maybe I mostly spent those five months putting it
off. But you can imagine what it'd look like if I spent 110-hour weeks on it!
It would have been magical!

Instead, I bring you this one.

## V A G R A N C E P T I O N

This stems from my love for [Vagrant][2], a command-line interface to
[VirtualBox][3], which is Oracle's open source virtualization software. If you
ever need to build up and tear down virtual machines, do check it out.

## The Process

So it gets a little complicated at the end. Watch the screencast first — I
don't want to SPOILER ALERT you all over the place! — but then you can check
out the project [README][4] to see how all the individual parts are put
together.
