I love Apple. I love Apple so much that if someone gave me a bulletproof vest
made out of MacBook Airs, I'd strap it to my back and take a bullet to my chest
to protect my precious aluminum friends.

But Steve's lying to us when it comes to [FaceTime][facetime].

> "And we're going to take it all the way. We're going to the standards bodies,

Steve went on stage and announced this to the world. Rumor is he also
simultaneously announced it to the majority of the FaceTime team, who until
that moment hadn't yet been informed that their work was going to be
standardized.

There's certainly a possibility that FaceTime may still be ratified as an open
standard. Maybe Steve just misspoke when he gave concrete dates and steps to
open up the FaceTime protocol. Maybe it happens the day after I publish this
blog post. But regardless of the reason, we are stuck here more than a year
later, with FaceTime siloed strictly to Apple devices and (to my knowledge)
zero standards bodies reviewing a proposed FaceTime protocol spec.

## OpenFaceTimeâ„¢

If FaceTime were open, we'd certainly see people working on integrating it.
Within a day of Jobs' announcement, [Skype had said][skype] that they were
interested in the technology available through FaceTime. I'd wager good money
that some of the Android-based phones would add FaceTime as an option. And the
indie market would have a blast... depending on how "open" FaceTime would be,
I'm sure we'd be building FaceTime into [Hubot][hubot], our chat room robot at
GitHub.

Increasing the number of FaceTime-equipped devices means that FaceTime moves
from a novelty that you use when you stumble into a bar and find out it has
free Wi-Fi, to a serious communication medium that can start to supplant
telephone calls themselves.

## "Open" isn't just a buzz word

**"Open" isn't just a buzz word**. People like the word "open". Marketers love it.
It sounds inviting. It sounds safe. But it's fundamentally an important concept
in computer science. Open source, open guidelines, transparent motivations.
These concepts *actually mean* something to us.

If a company goes on record and says they're going to open up, we need to hold
their feet to the fire. We need to make it clear that you can't garner goodwill
by embracing openness while at the same time not delivering on that promise.

The stakes are just too high not to pursue this admirable goal. To be truly
happy, I need to be able to FaceTime in ASCII from my scientific calculator. Or
mount a FaceTime camera to my dog. Or run it through a Visual Basic GUI and
give my recipient a really huge nose. The point is: open is open, and FaceTime
is not. Apple needs to fix that or fess up.
