title: "How GitHub Works"

I have a [public repository][feedback] on GitHub open as an "ask me anything"
area. One of the [questions][questions] that came through was from [Chris
Ledet][chris]:

I love talking about this stuff. Not because I really dig working at GitHub (I
do), but because I think we've finally figured out what makes us productive and
happy. That's hard to find in some companies.

These posts are ostensibly about GitHub, but that's just so there's something
concrete to write about. These posts are really about **how you can improve
your company's work atmosphere**.

I hate multi-part everything on the internet, but not as much as I hate
entirely too-long posts. So I split it up into three parts spread out over
three days.

### [Hours are Bullshit][hours]

Most companies want you to get to work early and stay late. The metric should
be productivity, not hours.

### [Be Asynchronous][async]

You can get more done by being more direct, less intrusive, and more
cooperative with your coworkers.

### [Creativity is Important][creativity]

Code is creativity. Fostering an atmosphere where people can be creative will
lead to better code.
