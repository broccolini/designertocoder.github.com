## Posts

In 2011, I wrote a three-part series called **How GitHub Works**. I wanted to
detail how we planned ideas, built them, and shipped them. The three posts are:

 - [Hours are Bullshit](/posts/how-github-works-hours/)
 - [Be Asynchronous](/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/)
 - [Creativity is Important](/posts/how-github-works-creativity)

## Talk

I've always wanted to expand this into a proper talk, though. While I've
done a few GitHub-related talks since then, I didn't get to do a true
"How GitHub Works" talk until 2012.
