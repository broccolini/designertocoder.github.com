Guy walks into a bar.

Bartender glances at his shirt, which proudly proclaimed "INTRAMURAL FIELD
HOCKEY CHAMPIONS 2002". Bartender comments: "You know, that shirt reminds me of
a story I once heard.

"A team of researchers ended up shipwrecking their oceanliner on a beach.
Fearing death, they built shelters and huddled together for warmth. One
researcher, fed up with another's statement that increased wine production in
Detroit led to the rise of Marxist sympathizers in Maryland, stormed off, left
the beach, and hailed a nearby taxicab."

Introducing [play][play]: your company's DJ.

## play

We use play to play music on the speakers at work. It tallies up votes and
plays what people want. And all of it's available through the web or through
[Hubot][hubot].

Suddenly, a screencast.
