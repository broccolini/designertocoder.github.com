title: How to Screencast Your Talk

So you're nervously up on stage in front of hundreds of strangers about to give
a talk, sweating profusely, petrified that you might get your own name wrong.

SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TIME TO RECORD YOUR WEAKNESS AND UNCERTAINTY!

After my [What They Don't Tell You About Public Speaking](http://zachholman.com/posts/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-public-speaking/) post made the rounds this week, I got a number of questions asking
about how I record the audio and slide transitions of my talks.

## QuickTime on OS X

There's a million ways to do this. Keynote, for example, has a recording
function built directly into presenter mode, although it's difficult to tweak
and to export. Beyond that, there's a million different apps you can use to do
this, too. I try to stay as simple as possible: on my Mac, I just use
QuickTime's *Screen Recording* feature.

Either before a talk on-stage or at home practicing my slides, running a quick
screen recording session is pretty simple. Start a new Screen Recording:

![Screen Recording](http://cl.ly/16413P1u0s0b1m3k1i1Z/content)

...then hit record:

![Record](http://cl.ly/301V370n2G12360V0A0s/content)

If you're on stage and on a projector, the trick is to get QuickTime to record
your *projected slides* rather than your presenter display. Luckily, QuickTime
makes it really easy. Before you start your slideshow, hit record, then mouse
over to the other screen (in other words, the projector). It'll dim the screen
and inform you:

![Click to Record](http://cl.ly/3w2K2e3d0d3r2s2Y1X0f/content)

Click it, then you're off to the races. It'll record your voice on your internal
microphone (surprisingly well, too), and as you flip through your slides it'll
retain all the transitions and little details you can't get from viewing slides
online.

## It's for you

The best thing about recording your talks is that it's a great learning tool.
It's clich√©, but force yourself to listen to yourself. It will **utterly change
your perspective**. You'll hear all of the *uhhhhh*s and *ummmmm*s you didn't
notice at the time. That's good; listening to yourself talk is designed to make
you angry enough to change those habits.

## It's for them

As I mentioned previously, your mileage may vary when it comes to conference
videos of your talks. Half of conferences won't film you, and the other half may
take months to publish all their talks while organizers take a well-deserved
breather post-conference.

So think about recording your own talk so you can post it on your site
immediately after your talk. If you've wowed someone in the room, they'll be
able to share the experience of your talk to their friends as soon as possible.

I use [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) for [my screencasts and talks](https://vimeo.com/holman)
because they're a swell company.

## It's mostly for me

Slides are great, but audio and video is better. Record your talks,
because I want to see and learn from them. I'm totally selfish like that.
