    <p>You can find Mr. Holman <a href="http://twitter.com/holman">on Twitter</a> or send him <a
    href="mailto:&#109;&#105;&#110;&#101;&#115;&#104;&#097;&#102;&#116;&#045;&#103;&#097;&#112;&#064;&#122;&#097;&#099;&#104;&#104;&#111;&#108;&#109;&#097;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">an email</a>.</p>

    <p>Mr. Holman currently builds internet at <a
    href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. He leads development on <a
    href="http://fi.github.com">Firewall Install</a>, a private GitHub for your
    clearly intelligent and forward-thinking company.</p>

    <p>For the last decade, Mr. Holman has also crafted <a
    href="http://www.good-tutorials.com">Good-Tutorials</a>, which has amassed
    such a darling display of design and programming tutorials that it's
    advised not to look directly into the page for fear of going blind.</p>

    <p>He also got a lot of exposure and press for <a
    href="http://facelette.com">Facelette</a>, a ridiculous experiment. You may
    be interested in <a
    href="http://zachholman.com/2010/10/facelette-on-techcrunch-in-three-hours-and-zero-dollars/">reading
    his post</a> about it.</p>

    <p>Mr. Holman enthusiasticly resides in San Francisco, California. He does
    miss his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, and severely misses Pittsburgh,
    Pennslyvania, where he attended <a href="http://cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon
    University</a>.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or feedback about Mr. Holman, check out the
    issues on <a href="https://github.com/holman/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1">holman/feedback</a>
    on GitHub. It's sort of like an "Ask Me Anything" setup, except it uses a
    nerdy social network and crams it into a bug tracker.</p>
