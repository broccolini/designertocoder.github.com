Hi. This is a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered blog hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for [zachholman.com](http://zachholman.com). Feel free to browse the source, fork, [ask me questions](http://twitter.com/holman), and post your own compelling blog posts. Because sharing is caring. We're developers, after all.

## The design

Here's the deal. This is my blog, and there's certainly a distinctive look and feel associated with it. I'd appreciate it if you changed your own fork. If you'll notice, there's no license attached to this project, so technically I maintain the rights associated with this project.

So be cool, change things up, find your own voice. It'll work better for you in the long run, too.
