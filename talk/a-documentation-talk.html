  <h1>A Documentation Talk</h1>

  <p>"A Documentation Talk" sounds pretty boring, right? Wouldn't it be
  scandalously titillating if this talk's title included detailed analysis of
  the expectations and results of the talk itself? Jeez it's like someone's
  making an overt metaphor for how Rubyists document their code.</p>

  <p>At GitHub, we add docs to every single method we write, and we couldn't be more
  excited about it. It means faster and simpler code. It means stronger tests. It
  means your developers can pay attention to new commits without stressing about
  them. Documentation will make your project so very happy.</p>
