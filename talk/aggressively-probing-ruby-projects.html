  <h1>Aggressively Probing Ruby Projects</h1>
  <h3>A Ruby Code Analysis Project</h3>

  <p>I just gave a talk in Krak√≥w at
    <a href="http://railsberry.com">Railsberry</a> where I announced
    <a href="https://github.com/holman/hopper">Hopper</a>, an open source Ruby
    code analysis project.</p>

  <h3>Hopper</h3>
  <p>
    Hopper is a Sinatra app designed to pull down tens of thousands of Ruby
    projects from GitHub, snapshot each repository into ten equidistant
    revisions, run them through a battery of tests (which we call Probes), and
    hopefully come up with some deeply moving insights about how we write Ruby.
  </p>

  <h3>Codestat</h3>
  <p>Codestat is the live version of Hopper. It's available at
     <a href="http://codestat.us">codestat.us</a></p>

  <h3>The Future</h3>
  <p>Codestat is a bit of a work-in-progress. It's running on an underpowered
    instance, and I'm pretty sure I might be blowing out the database from time
    to time as we settle on what makes sense to model all the data.</p>

  <p>Hopper is one big experiment. I think where it is today is a long throw
    away from where it could be tomorrow. I welcome your thoughts, issues, and
    Pull Requests as we build something nifty together.</p>
