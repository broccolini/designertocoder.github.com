  <h1>Git and GitHub Secrets</h1>

  <p>We tuck a lot of features away on github.com.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the UI just hasn't been fleshed out. Or we have bigger plans in
     mind for the feature in the future. Or it just hasn't been finished yet.
     But we still want to give you the flexibility of using that feature today.
  </p>

  <p>The same can be said about Git. If you've ever looked at the manpages,
     there's feature after feature and option after option in its binaries. Part
     of the strength of Git and GitHub is having access to those features when
     you need them, and getting them out of your way when you don't.</p>

  <p>This talk covers both Git and GitHub: different tricks I've picked up after
     two years at GitHub, helpful advice on common gripes I've seen in support
     tickets and tweets, and just general nifty things that make you a faster,
     more capable technologist.</p>
