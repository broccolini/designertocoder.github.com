  <h1>How GitHub Uses GitHub to Build GitHub</h1>

  <p>Build features fast. Ship them. That's what we try to do at GitHub.
  Our process is the anti-process: what's the minimum overhead we can put
  up with to keep our code quality high, all while building features *as
  quickly as possible*? It's not just features, either: faster
  development means happier developers.</p>
