    <p>Hey, I like to talk. If you're interested in stealing me for your own conference, you should really <a href="mailto:talks@zachholman.com">get in touch</a>.</p>

        <p>Build features fast. Ship them. That's what we try to do at GitHub.
        Our process is the anti-process: what's the minimum overhead we can put
        up with to keep our code quality high, all while building features *as
        quickly as possible*? It's not just features, either: faster
        development means happier developers.</p>

      <div class="details">
        <p>"A Documentation Talk" sounds pretty boring, right? Wouldn't it be
        *scandalously titillating* if this talk's title included detailed
        analysis of the expectations and results of the talk itself? Jeez it's
        like someone's making an overt metaphor for how Rubyists document their
        code.</p>
